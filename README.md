# MADA Mod
  A mod for cataclysm which adds a bat mutation category, working as of 0.E-7938

## Overview
I saw a comment on reddit saying that bows used to be good, and i understand the "used to" since atm they are completely useless when compared to guns, with the only bonus of their ammo being easy to produce (but still harder to get since zombies don't drop bolts nor arrows), this is mostly due to a focus on realism (which is understandable since it's what the game is about) but as a consequence these become unusable, their size, low fire rate and mediocre damage makes them sometimes even dangerous to use. This mod greatly decreases their dispersion (since they NEVER hit anything), boosts damage and rises range a bit (are you gonna tell me that throwing range is 40 but a bow can't shoot more than 12 tiles away?) and greatly decreases corssbow reload time to make them usable without the need to run away 10 tiles each time you shoot These changes makes bows more on par with pistols, they remain weaker than them and their bigger size makes them inferior to them, but they make up for it with their expendable ammo, most changes are only to the weapons, not to their ammo. Sizes remain unchanged but some bows had their strength requirement lowered a bit to make them more manageable (by the time you get to 17 strength, you have no use for bows so...)
